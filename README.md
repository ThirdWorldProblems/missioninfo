Mozilla's Mission:Information Curriculum 
<p>Hello and welcome!</p>
<p><strong>What is Mission:Information?</strong></p>
<p>Mozilla's Mission:Information Curriculum is an open-source and interactive set of three lessons that help teens develop news and web literacy skills, and have some fun while doing so. This curriculum was created as a way to help teens deal with fake news and misinformation that they might encounter online. A main goal of this curriculum is to empower learners to become strong consumers, producers, and distributors of news and media.</p> 
<p><strong>Who created Mission:Information?</strong></p>
<p>This curriculum was developed by Nucleus Learning Network, Open Austin, and The Austin Monitor in partnership with Mozilla.</p>
<p><strong>What are some ways to get involved and learn more?</strong></p>
<p>This open-source curriculum project is hopefully the start of something bigger. These three lessons serve as a foundation to help teens develop news and web literacy skills, but there is a lot of room to grow. Here are some ways to get involved.
